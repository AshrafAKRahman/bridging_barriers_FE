              Use a simple format Your CV should be plain, easy to read, and
              structured in a way that highlights your core skills and recent
              work experience. ● Put your name and contact details in the header
              It’s important to leave your name and contact details on your CV,
              so that potential employers can get hold of you for an interview.
              ● Structure your roles for easy reading Long sentences and chunky
              paragraphs are a big no when it comes to any CV. You want the
              reading experience to be as easy as possible for the recruiter, so
              offering bite-sized, memorable information is preferable.

              ● Not tailoring your CV When hiring, recruiters look at a huge
              number of applications. That means they know what a generic CV
              looks like, and you don’t want to get passed over because your CV
              didn’t do enough to stand out. If you aren’t tailoring your CV to
              the specific company and role, it says to them that you’re not
              that interested in their position – instead, you simply want any
              job you can get. This definitely won’t leave a positive impression
              on employers ● Not using keywords effectively Keywords can make or
              break your CV. If you don’t use them at all, the recruiter might
              find it harder to see why you’re a good match for the role ●
              Including relevant information Your CV should be no longer than
              two A4 pages; even better if you can keep it to just one. This
              means you simply don’t have the space to cover irrelevant
              information. You need to include only the skills, qualifications,
              hobbies and employment history that are actually relevant to the
              role you’re applying for ● Spelling or grammatical errors Last,
              but certainly not least, you must make sure you proofread your
              application before submitting. If your CV is full of spelling and
              grammatical errors, it can look unprofessional or like you didn’t
              care enough about the role to bother re-reading your application.
              Proofread your CV several times before applying and perhaps even
              have someone else look over it just to be sure.

              How to update your CV without ruining it
            </h1>
            <p className="text-white  mt-10">
              ● Tailor to the specific job One of the most important rules when
              preparing your CV is to tailor it to the specific job description
              and the charity you’re applying for. No two jobs are the same,
              and, likewise, no two CVs you hand in should be the same. ● Make
              it easier on the eyes When updating your CV, don’t just tweak the
              text—be mindful of the design, as well. Make sure there’s plenty
              of white space so it’s easy for the hiring manager to read. Use
              clear headings for the various subsections to allow them to skim
              straight to the parts which interest them the most. ● Remove old
              and irrelevant entries As you dust off your CV to bring it up to
              date, it may be time to prune previous entries to make space for
              new experience and achievements. If you’ve had over a decade in
              your career path already, leave off some of your earliest entries,
              particularly when they have nothing to do with your profession
              now.

            <p className="text-white  mt-10">
              ● Show rather than tell Without evidence, anything you write on
              your CV is just your opinion, so it’s important to back up
              statements with facts. ● Present evidence Gather evidence for your
              CV by keeping notes on your performance and achievements at work
              throughout the year. List any awards, nominations or special
              recognition you’ve received and save any positive feedback or
              endorsements from colleagues or customers ● Be authentic Not being
              true to yourself is unlikely to lead to happiness and success in a
              job, so if you’re offered a role based on a different version of
              yourself, how can you be the real you while doing it? Trust in
              yourself and be honest about difficulties you’ve faced at work and
              how you’ve overcome them. This will show you to be humble and
              authentic.

              ● It is easy to read Anyone reading your CV is short on time.
              They’re not looking forward to processing a pile of applications.
              But if your CV is ready to go, you’ve used some tricks to make it
              easy to process. You’ve carefully weighed what to include, where
              to include it and how to word it. ● It has a professional-looking
              design If you want your CV to be readable, you have to design it
              well. That means text placement, text size, white space, font
              type, font effects and whatever features you end up integrating:
              columns, colours, etc. ● Your CV highlights your transferable
              experiences The person reading your CV is less interested in every
              task you perform than in the skills you can do as a result of
              performing those tasks. And not every skill you have needs to have
              been gained in that sector. Many soft skills can be transferred
              from jobs you just need to know how to frame them

              5 things to do after a job interview
            </h1>
            <p className="text-white  mt-10">
              Write everything down Immediately after your interview, write down
              everything you can remember about it. Include things you wish
              you’d said and identify any weak points. Also jot down any
              questions you’d like to ask or information you’d need if you were
              made an offer. This is all useful learning ● Send a thank you
              email It’s polite to thank the interviewers and it also shows that
              you’re still interested in the role. Hopefully you’ll have asked
              for the contact details at the end of the interview but if someone
              from HR did the organising, then you can send your message to them
              to forward on. Ideally do this within 24 hours, but don’t wait
              longer than two to three days. ● Prepare for a job offer We know
              you don’t have an offer yet and you don’t want to jinx it by being
              presumptuous, BUT you also don’t want to be on the back foot if
              you do receive good news. So now’s the time to prepare. Decide
              what your deal breakers are, work out the minimum salary you’d
              accept and how you’d want to negotiate. You could also be asked to
              provide references, so it’s a good idea to start preparing for
              this. ● Prepare for bad news Just as you should be prepared for an
              offer, you should also prepare for a rejection. And by this we
              mean continue browsing and applying for jobs, and going to
              interviews. Having more options is good for a number of reasons:
              less disappointment if you don’t get a role, more practice at
              applying and interviewing and a better understanding of what you
              really want from your next role.
